        <p class="paragraph-style">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a powerful tool used in web design to control the layout, appearance, and formatting of HTML documents. It allows developers to create visually appealing web pages by defining styles for elements such as text, colors, spacing, and positioning. With CSS, developers can achieve a consistent and responsive design across different devices and screen sizes. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), it also enhances maintainability and scalability of web projects.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-style">CSS provides a range of styling options, including the ability to adjust fonts, colors, backgrounds, borders, and even animations. It uses selectors to target specific HTML elements, making it highly versatile for designing layouts, such as grids and flexbox models, which adapt to varying screen sizes. CSS also supports advanced features like media queries for responsive design, ensuring that web pages look great on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Overall, CSS plays a crucial role in enhancing both the aesthetics and functionality of websites.</p>
